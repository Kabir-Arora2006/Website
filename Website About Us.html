Who am I?
<br>
Suhani Chatterjee, a student of Grade 9 Pathways Aravalli. She is a hardworking student who really likes to do Art and Crochet. 
Crochet is a needlework method that involves using a crochet hook and fiber or any comparable material to make a project and she really likes to do 
hand drawn art other than digital art. She excels in every subject and can overcome any situation.

Why create the website?
<br>
I created the website to helpout Suhani in her business. She wanted to raise money to donate to charity by making crochet and art and sell them.
Due to Covid-19, the crochet and art plan started to come to an end. Until I gave the idea to make the website to start up the business again.

<br>
How do we know if we are real people and not scammers?
<br>
On suhani's instagram, you can see the posts and orders she has recieved, to show that we are not fake and she really does make art and crochet for the clients.
